Recommended resources
'''''''''''''''''''''

The following collection of resources are things I have found useful during my reliability engineering studies and also while writing the Python reliability library. There are many other resources available (especially textbooks and academic papers), so I encourage you to do your own research. If you find something you think is worth adding here, please send me an email (alpha.reliability@gmail.com).

-    The reliability analytics toolkit (linked below in free online tools and calculators) has also compiled a much more comprehensive `list of textbooks <https://reliabilityanalyticstoolkit.appspot.com/static/books.htm#0486438678>`_.

**Free software**

-    `Lifelines <https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ - a Python library for survival analysis. Very powerful collection of tools, only a few of which overlap with the Python reliability library.
-    `Parameter Solver v3.0 <https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/SoftwareDownload/SingleSoftware/Index/6>`_ - a biostatistics tool for quickly making some simple calculations with probability distributions.
-    `Orange <https://orange.biolab.si/>`_ - a standalone data mining and data visualization program that runs using Python. Beautifully interactive data analysis workflows with a large toolbox. Not much reliability related content but good for data preprocessing.
-    R (Programming Language) - R is one of the most popular programming languages for data science, and it has several libraries that are targeted towards reliability engineering and survival analysis. These include `WeibullR <https://github.com/openrelia/WeibullR.gallery>`_, `abrem <https://rdrr.io/rforge/abrem/>`_, and `survival <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html>`_. 
-    `CumFreq <https://www.waterlog.info/cumfreq.htm>`_ - a program for cumulative frequency analysis with probability distribution fitting for a wide range of distributions. Limited functionality beyond fitting distributions.
-    `OpenTURNS <https://openturns.github.io/openturns/latest/auto_probabilistic_modeling/index.html>`_ - a Python library for the treatment of uncertainties, risks and statistics. This library contains many powerful statistical functions, some of which are applicable to reliability engineering (mainly the fitting of distributions). The syntax of the library requires many steps as shown in the tutorials.

**Paid software**

The listing of a software package here does not imply my endorsement, and is only intended to give readers an understanding of the broad range of reliability engineering software packages that are available. It is difficult to find a comprehensive list of software resources since most developers of proprietary software rarely acknowledge the existence of any software other than their own. I have not used most of the paid software listed here due to the high cost, so most of my comments in this section are based purely on the content from their websites.

-    `Minitab <https://www.minitab.com/en-us/>`_ - a great collection of statistical tools. A few reliability focussed tools included.
-    `Reliasoft <https://www.reliasoft.com/products/reliability-analysis/weibull>`_ - the industry leader for reliability engineering software.
-    `SAS JMP <https://www.jmp.com/en_us/software/predictive-analytics-software.html>`_ - lots of statistical tools for data modelling and visualization. A few purpose built reliability tools. Its utility for reliability engineering will depend on your application. SAS has also released the `SAS University Edition <https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html>`_ which is a free software package that runs in VirtualBox and offers a reduced set of tools compared to the paid package.
-    `PTC Windchill <https://www.ptc.com/en/products/plm/capabilities/quality/>`_ - a powerful tool for risk and reliability. Similar to Reliasoft but it forms one part of the larger PTC suite of tools.
