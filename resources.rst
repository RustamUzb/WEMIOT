**Free online tools and calculators**

-    `Reliability Analytics Toolkit <https://reliabilityanalyticstoolkit.appspot.com/>`_ - a collection of tools which run using the Google App Engine. Includes a `tool <https://reliabilityanalyticstoolkit.appspot.com/weibull_analysis>`_ for fitting a Weibull_2P distribution.
-    `Weibull App <https://carlescg.shinyapps.io/abrem_app/>`_ - An online tool for fitting a Weibull_2P distibution. Download the example template to see what format the app is expecting your data to be in before you can upload your own data. The backend is powered by the abrem R package. This tool has limited applications beyond fitting a Weibull_2P distribution.
-    `Distributome <http://www.distributome.org/V3/calc/index.html>`_ - Provides PDF and CDF of a large number of probability distributions that can be easily changed using sliders for their parameters. It also includes a quantile / CDF calculator. Similar to the Distribution calculator below.
-    `Distribution Calculator <https://www.randomservices.org/random/apps/SpecialCalculator.html>`_ - Provides PDF and CDF of a large number of probability distributions that can be easily changed using sliders for their parameters. It also includes a quantile / CDF calculator. Similar to Distributome above.
-    `Kijima G-renewal process <http://www.soft4structures.com/WeibullGRP/JSPageGRP.jsp>`_ - an online calculator for simulating the G-renewal process.
-    `Prediction of future recurrent events <http://www.soft4structures.com/WeibullGRP/JSPageGRPinverse_1.jsp>`_ - an online calculator for predicting future recurrent events with different underlying probability functions.
-    `Maintenance optimization <http://www.soft4structures.com/WeibullGRP/JSPageMTN.jsp>`_ - an online calculator for optimal replacement policy (time) under Kijima imperfect repair model.
-    `e-Fatigue <https://www.efatigue.com/constantamplitude/stressconcentration/>`_ - This website provides stress concentration factors (Kt) for various notched geometries. You will need this if using the functions for fracture mechanics in the Physics of Failure section.
-    `Fault Tree Analyser <https://www.fault-tree-analysis-software.com/fault-tree-analysis>`_ - A simple online tool where you can build a fault tree, give each branch a failure rate and run a variety of reports including reliability prediction at time, minimal cut sets, and several others.
-    `Wolfram Alpha <https://www.wolframalpha.com/>`_ - an amazing computational knowledge engine. Great for checking your calculations.
-    `Derivative calculator <https://www.derivative-calculator.net/>`_ - calculates derivatives. Slightly more user friendly input method than Wolfram alpha and doesn't time out as easily for big calculations.
-    `Integral calculator <https://www.integral-calculator.com/>`_ - calculates integrals. Slightly more user friendly input method than Wolfram alpha and doesn't time out as easily for big calculations.
-    `GeoGebra <https://www.geogebra.org/calculator>`_ - An interactive calculator that is extremely useful for plotting equations. Also includes many mathematical operations (such as integrals and derivatives) that allow you to keep your equations in symbolic form. You can download your current calculator to save it. The only downside is that there are not many probability distribution functions inbuilt so you will need to enter the `equations <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Equations%20of%20supported%20distributions.html>`_ manually.
-    `NewReleases.io <https://newreleases.io/>`_ - This website allows you to setup email notifications for when a new release of `reliability` (or any other package) is uploaded to PyPI. While not exactly a tool for reliability engineering, it is very useful to let you know when it's time to upgrade your version of `reliability`.

**Online information resources**

-    `Reliawiki <http://reliawiki.org/index.php/Life_Data_Analysis_Reference_Book>`_ - an excellent reference written by Reliasoft that is intended largely as a guide to reliability engineering when using Reliasoft's software but is equally as good to understand concepts without using their software.
-    `Reliasoft's Accelerated Life Testing Data Analysis Reference <http://reliawiki.com/index.php/Accelerated_Life_Testing_Data_Analysis_Reference>`_
-    `Reliasoft's collection of Military Directives, Handbooks and Standards Related to Reliability <https://www.weibull.com/knowledge/milhdbk.htm>`_
-    `Univariate distributions relationships <http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/chart/UDR/UDR.html>`_ - a great interactive diagram for understanding more about probability distributions and how they are related. Some strange parametrisations are used in the documentation.
-    `Cross Validated <https://stats.stackexchange.com/>`_ - an forum for asking statistics and mathematics questions. Check for existing answers before posting your own question.
-    `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/>`_ - a forum for programmers where you can post questions and answers related to programming. Check for existing answers before posting your own question.
-    `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering>`_ - it's always worth checking if there's an article on there about the topic you're trying to understand.

**Getting free access to academic papers**

-    `arXiv <https://arXiv.org>`_ - a database run by Cornell university that provides open access to over 1.5 million academic papers that have been submitted. If you can't find it here then check on Sci-Hub.
-    `Sci-Hub <https://sci-hub.st/>`_ - paste in a DOI to get a copy of the academic paper. Accessing academic knowledge should be free and this site makes it possible.
